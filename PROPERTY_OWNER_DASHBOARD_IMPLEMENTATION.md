# Property Owner Dashboard Implementation

## Overview
Created a dynamic Property Owner Dashboard that adapts based on the services they use (rental, house watching, or both).

## Files Created

### 1. `src/hooks/usePropertyOwnerMetrics.ts`
- Custom hook that fetches and calculates all metrics for property owners
- Automatically detects service type: `'rental' | 'house_watching' | 'both' | 'none'`
- Queries multiple tables:
  - `property_owners` - owner record
  - `property_owner_associations` - property ownership
  - `properties` - property details
  - `tenants` - rental service indicator
  - `house_watching` - house watching service indicator
  - `maintenance_requests` - pending maintenance
  - `rent_rolls` - income calculation
  - `home_check_sessions` - check statistics

**Metrics Calculated:**
- Total properties
- Total tenants
- Monthly income
- Pending maintenance
- Occupancy rate
- Active house watching services
- Last/next check dates
- Total checks this year
- Portfolio value (estimated)

### 2. `src/pages/dashboards/PropertyOwnerHub.tsx`
- Main dashboard component with three variations based on service type
- Dynamic metrics display
- Service-specific quick actions
- Activity feed filtered to owner's properties
- Quick navigation cards

- Only accessible by users with `owner_investor` role
- Uses RoleBasedAccess wrapper

## Features

1. **Dynamic Service Detection**
   - Automatically determines which services the owner uses
   - Adapts dashboard layout and metrics accordingly

2. **Comprehensive Metrics**
   - Real-time data from multiple database tables
   - Financial metrics (income, portfolio value)
   - Operational metrics (occupancy, maintenance)
   - Service metrics (checks, schedules)

3. **Smart Quick Actions**
   - Context-aware based on services
   - Direct links to most-used features

   - Property address context

5. **Responsive Design**
   - Mobile-optimized layout
   - Card-based grid system

## Next Steps

To complete role-based dashboard routing:

1. **Update AppSidebar**: Make "Home" link dynamic based on role
2. **Create Tenant Dashboard**: Simpler metrics focused on lease/rent
3. **Create Property Manager Dashboard**: Focus on assigned properties
4. **Create House Watcher Dashboard**: Schedule and check-focused
5. **Add Login Redirect Logic**: Route to appropriate dashboard on login

## Database Dependencies

Requires proper RLS policies on:
- `property_owners`
- `property_owner_associations`
- `tenants`
- `house_watching`
- `maintenance_requests`
- `rent_rolls`
- `home_check_sessions`

All policies already in place for owner access control.
