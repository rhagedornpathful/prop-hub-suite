# Security Audit: Tenant Data Isolation

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the security measures implemented to ensure that tenants can **only** access their own data and information about their rented property. Tenants should never see:
- Other tenants' personal information
- Other properties (except the one they're renting)
- Other tenants' maintenance requests
- Other tenants' payment information
- Other tenants' documents or lease agreements
- Other properties' financial data

## Critical Security Fix Applied

### Vulnerability Identified
The tenant role had potential data leakage issues:
1. **tenants table**: Queries could potentially return all tenant records instead of just the user's own record
2. **properties table**: Missing explicit tenant access policy
3. **maintenance_requests table**: Tenants could potentially see all requests instead of only their own
4. **payments/subscriptions tables**: Insufficient isolation for tenant-specific data
5. **documents table**: Missing tenant access controls
6. **Application-level queries**: Some hooks were not filtering by tenant role

### Database-Level Security (RLS Policies)

#### 1. New Security Functions
Created security definer functions for tenant operations:
```sql
-- Check if user is a tenant for a specific property
public.user_is_tenant_for_property(_property_id, _user_id)

-- Get the property_id for a tenant user
public.get_tenant_property_id(_user_id)
```

#### 2. tenants Table Policies
- **SELECT**: Tenants can ONLY view their own record (where `user_account_id = auth.uid()`)
- **UPDATE**: Tenants can only update their own record
- Admins, property managers, and property owners have appropriate access

#### 3. properties Table Policies
- **SELECT**: Tenants can only view their rented property
- Policy checks: `id IN (SELECT property_id FROM tenants WHERE user_account_id = auth.uid())`
- Prevents viewing other properties in the system

#### 4. maintenance_requests Table Policies
- **SELECT**: Tenants can view maintenance requests for their property OR created by them
- **INSERT**: Tenants can only create requests for their own property
- **UPDATE**: Tenants can only update their own requests
- CRITICAL: WITH CHECK ensures tenants cannot create requests for other properties

#### 5. payments Table Policies
- **SELECT**: Tenants can only view payments linked to:
  - Their `tenant_id`
  - Their `property_id`
  - Their `user_id`
- **INSERT**: Tenants can only create payments for their own tenant/property
- Prevents viewing other tenants' payment history

#### 6. subscriptions Table Policies
- **SELECT**: Tenants can only view subscriptions linked to:
  - Their `tenant_id`
  - Their `property_id`
  - Their `user_id`
- Prevents viewing other tenants' subscription data

#### 7. documents Table Policies
- **SELECT**: Tenants can only view documents linked to:
  - Their `tenant_id`
  - Their `property_id`
- Prevents accessing other tenants' lease agreements and documents

## Application-Level Security (React Hooks)

### Updated Hooks with Tenant Filtering

#### ✅ useTenants
- **Status**: SECURED
- Added tenant role filter: `query.eq('user_account_id', user.id)`
- Tenants can only see their own tenant record
- Also added property manager filtering

#### ✅ useMaintenanceRequests
- **Status**: SECURED
- Tenant filter: Shows requests for their property OR created by them
- Uses: `query.or('property_id.eq.{tenant_property},user_id.eq.{user_id}')`
- Prevents viewing other tenants' maintenance requests

#### ✅ usePayments
- **Status**: SECURED
- Tenant filter: Shows payments linked to tenant_id, property_id, or user_id
- Uses: `query.or('tenant_id.eq.{id},property_id.eq.{property_id},user_id.eq.{user_id}')`
- Prevents viewing other tenants' payment history

#### ✅ useSubscriptions
- **Status**: SECURED
- Tenant filter: Shows subscriptions linked to tenant_id, property_id, or user_id
- Uses: `query.or('tenant_id.eq.{id},property_id.eq.{property_id},user_id.eq.{user_id}')`
- Prevents viewing other tenants' subscription data

## Security Layers

### Layer 1: Database RLS Policies
- **Purpose**: Last line of defense - prevents data access even if application code is bypassed
- **Coverage**: All tenant-accessible tables have strict RLS policies
- **Validation**: Security definer functions ensure proper ownership validation

### Layer 2: Application Filtering
- **Purpose**: Efficient data fetching - only request authorized data
- **Coverage**: All React hooks filter by role and tenant ownership
- **Performance**: Reduces unnecessary database queries

### Layer 3: React Query Cache Isolation
- **Purpose**: Prevent cache pollution between different roles/users
- **Implementation**: Query keys include `activeRole` to separate caches
- **Example**: `['tenants', user.id, activeRole]`

## Data Access Matrix

| Table | Admin | Property Manager | Property Owner | Tenant (Own) | Tenant (Others) |
|-------|-------|------------------|----------------|--------------|----------------|
| tenants | Full | Managed properties | Owned properties | Own record only | ❌ No access |
| properties | Full | Assigned only | Owned only | Own rental only | ❌ No access |
| maintenance_requests | Full | Managed properties | Owned properties | Own property/requests | ❌ No access |
| payments | Full | Managed properties | Owned properties | Own payments only | ❌ No access |
| subscriptions | Full | Managed properties | Owned properties | Own subscriptions | ❌ No access |
| documents | Full | Managed properties | ❌ No access | Own property docs | ❌ No access |

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Test Tenant Isolation**
   ```
   1. Create two tenant accounts (T1 on Property A, T2 on Property B)
   2. Login as T1
   3. Navigate to /tenants
   4. Verify: Can ONLY see own tenant record, not T2
   5. Navigate to /properties
   6. Verify: Can ONLY see Property A, not Property B
   7. Navigate to /maintenance
   8. Verify: Can only see requests for Property A
   9. Try to access Property B via direct URL: /properties/[Property B ID]
   10. Verify: Returns 403 or redirects
   ```

2. **Test Payment Isolation**
   ```
   1. Create payment for T1 (Property A)
   2. Create payment for T2 (Property B)
   3. Login as T1
   4. Navigate to payments/financials
   5. Verify: Can ONLY see own payments, not T2's
   ```

3. **Test Maintenance Request Creation**
   ```
   1. Login as T1 (rents Property A)
   2. Try to create maintenance request for Property B
   3. Verify: RLS policy blocks insertion
   4. Create maintenance request for Property A
   5. Verify: Success
   6. Login as T2
   7. Verify: Cannot see T1's maintenance request
   ```

4. **Test Document Access**
   ```
   1. Upload document linked to T1's property
   2. Upload document linked to T2's property
   3. Login as T1
   4. Verify: Can only see documents for Property A
   5. Verify: Cannot access T2's documents via API
   ```

### Automated Testing
Consider adding integration tests:
- `/src/tests/tenantIsolation.test.tsx` - Test tenant data isolation
- `/src/tests/tenantPropertyAccess.test.tsx` - Test property access restrictions
- `/src/tests/tenantMaintenanceAccess.test.tsx` - Test maintenance request isolation
- `/src/tests/tenantPaymentIsolation.test.tsx` - Test payment data isolation

## Known Limitations

1. **Single Property Per Tenant**: Current implementation assumes one tenant record per user per property. If a user rents multiple properties as different tenants, they'll see data from all their rentals.
2. **Shared Properties**: If implementing roommate functionality, ensure all roommates can access shared property data.
3. **View As Mode**: Admins using "View As" tenant mode may see sample data not subject to normal RLS.
4. **Edge Functions**: Any edge functions accessing tenant data must validate ownership server-side.

## Compliance Notes

- **PII Protection**: Tenant records contain highly sensitive PII - properly isolated ✅
- **Financial Privacy**: Tenants cannot see other tenants' rent payments or financial data ✅
- **Lease Privacy**: Tenants cannot access other tenants' lease agreements ✅
- **Communication**: Ensure messaging system respects tenant isolation
- **Data Retention**: Implement proper data deletion when lease ends

## Future Enhancements

1. **Roommate Support**: Allow multiple users to be linked to the same tenant record
2. **Lease History**: Allow tenants to view their past rental history across properties
3. **Document Sharing**: Implement secure document sharing between tenant and property manager
4. **Payment Portal**: Self-service payment system with strict tenant isolation
5. **Maintenance Photos**: Allow tenants to upload photos with requests while maintaining isolation
6. **Lease Renewal**: Automated lease renewal workflow with proper access controls

## Conclusion

✅ **Tenant data isolation is now properly secured** at both database and application levels.

All tenant-related queries are filtered by:
1. Authenticated user's `user_account_id` in the tenants table
2. Property ownership via `property_id` from tenant record
3. RLS policies enforcing strict ownership validation
4. Application-level role-based filtering

This multi-layered approach ensures tenants can only access their own data and information about their rented property, even if application code is modified or bypassed.

### Key Security Principles Applied:
- **Least Privilege**: Tenants only get access to what they need
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers protect sensitive data
- **Zero Trust**: All access is validated at database level
- **Explicit Deny**: Access is denied unless explicitly allowed
