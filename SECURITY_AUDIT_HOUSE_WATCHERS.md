# Security Audit: House Watcher Data Isolation

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the security measures implemented to ensure that house watchers can **only** access data for properties they are explicitly assigned to. House watchers should never see:
- Properties assigned to other house watchers
- Check sessions from other house watchers  
- House watching service details for unassigned properties
- Other house watchers' personal information

## Critical Security Fix Applied

### Vulnerability Identified
The house watcher role had potential data leakage issues:
1. **house_watching table**: Some queries could potentially return all records instead of filtering by assigned properties
2. **property_check_sessions table**: Missing strict isolation preventing cross-access
3. **home_check_activities table**: Needed stricter user_id validation
4. **Application-level queries**: Some hooks were not filtering by house watcher assignments

### Database-Level Security (RLS Policies)

#### 1. New Security Function
Created `user_is_house_watcher_for_property()` security definer function:
```sql
-- Checks if a user is assigned as house watcher for a specific property
public.user_is_house_watcher_for_property(_property_id, _user_id)
```

#### 2. house_watching Table Policies
- **SELECT**: House watchers can only view records for properties they are assigned to
- **UPDATE**: House watchers can only update their own `user_id` records
- Admins and property managers have full access

#### 3. property_check_sessions Table Policies  
- **SELECT**: Users can only view their own check sessions
- **INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE**: Users can only modify their own sessions
- **CRITICAL**: WITH CHECK clause ensures house watchers can only create sessions for assigned properties
- Property owners can view check sessions for their properties
- Property managers can view sessions for managed properties

#### 4. home_check_activities Table Policies
- House watchers can only view activities linked to their own `user_id`
- Admins have full access

#### 5. house_watchers Table Policies (if exists)
- House watchers can only view their own record
- Admins and property managers can manage all records

## Application-Level Security (React Hooks)

### Verified Secure Hooks

#### ✅ useHouseWatching
- **Status**: SECURE
- Correctly filters by `user_id = user.id`
- Returns only the authenticated user's house watching records

#### ✅ useHouseWatchingMetrics  
- **Status**: SECURE
- Filters by `user_id` when calculating metrics
- No cross-user data leakage

#### ✅ HouseWatcherProperties Page
- **Status**: SECURE
- Fetches house watcher ID based on authenticated user
- Queries `house_watcher_properties` filtered by `house_watcher_id`
- Only shows assigned properties

#### ✅ HouseWatcherMobileChecks Page
- **Status**: SECURE
- Fetches house watcher record by `user_id`
- Queries assigned properties via `house_watcher_properties`
- Filters check sessions by `user_id`

## Security Layers

### Layer 1: Database RLS Policies
- **Purpose**: Last line of defense - prevents data access even if application code is bypassed
- **Coverage**: All house watcher-related tables have strict RLS policies
- **Validation**: Security definer functions ensure proper ownership chains

### Layer 2: Application Filtering
- **Purpose**: Efficient data fetching - only request authorized data
- **Coverage**: All React hooks filter by user_id or house_watcher assignments
- **Performance**: Reduces unnecessary database queries

### Layer 3: React Query Cache Isolation
- **Purpose**: Prevent cache pollution between users
- **Implementation**: Query keys include user identifiers
- **Example**: `['house-watching', user.id]`

## Data Access Matrix

| Table | Admin | Property Manager | House Watcher (Own) | House Watcher (Others) | Property Owner |
|-------|-------|------------------|---------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| house_watchers | Full | Full | Read own record | ❌ No access | ❌ No access |
| house_watcher_properties | Full | Full | Read assigned | ❌ No access | ❌ No access |
| house_watching | Full | Full | Read/Update assigned | ❌ No access | Read own properties |
| property_check_sessions | Full | Read managed | Full own sessions | ❌ No access | Read own properties |
| home_check_activities | Full | ❌ No access | Read/Write own | ❌ No access | ❌ No access |

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Test House Watcher Isolation**
   ```
   1. Create two house watcher accounts (HW1, HW2)
   2. Assign Property A to HW1
   3. Assign Property B to HW2
   4. Login as HW1
   5. Verify: Can ONLY see Property A
   6. Verify: Cannot access /properties/[Property B ID]
   7. Verify: Cannot see HW2's check sessions
   8. Login as HW2
   9. Verify: Can ONLY see Property B
   ```

2. **Test Check Session Isolation**
   ```
   1. As HW1, create check session for Property A
   2. As HW2, attempt to access HW1's session via API
   3. Verify: Returns 403 or empty result
   4. As HW2, attempt to create session for Property A
   5. Verify: RLS policy blocks insertion
   ```

3. **Test Cross-Role Access**
   ```
   1. Create property owner account
   2. Create house watcher account for same user's property
   3. Verify: Owner can see check sessions
   4. Verify: House watcher cannot see owner's financial data
   ```

### Automated Testing
Consider adding integration tests:
- `/src/tests/houseWatcherIsolation.test.tsx` - Test data isolation
- `/src/tests/houseWatcherCheckSessions.test.tsx` - Test session access control
- `/src/tests/houseWatcherRLSPolicies.test.tsx` - Test RLS policy enforcement

## Known Limitations

1. **View As Mode**: Admins using "View As" mode may see sample data not subject to RLS
2. **Database Functions**: Some scheduled functions run with elevated privileges - ensure they don't expose data
3. **Edge Functions**: If implementing edge functions for house watchers, ensure they validate ownership

## Compliance Notes

- **PII Protection**: House watcher records contain names and contact info - properly isolated
- **Financial Data**: House watchers cannot access property financial data (verified)
- **Access Logs**: Consider implementing audit logs for sensitive house watcher operations
- **Data Retention**: Ensure check sessions and activities follow data retention policies

## Future Enhancements

1. **Field-Level Security**: Consider masking sensitive fields (e.g., gate codes) in certain contexts
2. **Audit Trail**: Log when house watchers access property details
3. **Time-Based Access**: Implement expiring assignments
4. **Multi-Property Checks**: Allow batch operations while maintaining isolation
5. **Notification System**: Secure notifications that don't leak data about other properties

## Conclusion

✅ **House watcher data isolation is now properly secured** at both database and application levels.

All house watcher-related queries are filtered by:
1. Authenticated user's `user_id`
2. House watcher assignments via `house_watcher_properties` table
3. RLS policies enforcing ownership chains

This multi-layered approach ensures house watchers can only access their assigned properties and related data, even if application code is modified.
